Summary
===============================================================================
Proven researcher and developer with over 17 years experience and 75 published papers as a hands-on researcher, architect, manager, and developer in the design and development of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Information Retrieval systems for commercial and government customers. Pioneered new Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms to understand everything from how successful a group will be using their discussions to which occasions drive a consumer's purchase of product.

Work Experience
===============================================================================
Grubhub, New York, NY (Remote)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Data Scientist Team Lead*, *2017 - Present*

- Lead the NLP and taxonomy team to normalize and categorize menu items, dishes, and restaurants to improve customer experience when searching and discovering restaurants and cuisines on Grubhub.

Oculus360, Addison, TX
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Vice President of Technology*, *2014 - 2017*

- Led, designed, and implemented the Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Psycholinguistics algorithms driving Oculus360's consumer analytic platform, which  provides deep insights about consumers needs, wants, and desires. 
- Designed and Developed systems to automatically determine the aspects, or attributes, associated with a set of products in consumer vernacular, extract occasions in which individuals use or associate with a product, the emotional state and sensory perceptions provoked by a product, and the personality and demographics (gender and age) of the consumers reviewing, tweeting, or posting about a product.
- Developed methods and analyses have led to significant increases in customers' revenue due to sales campaigns and improved online product recommendation.
- Managed the development and data science team, which included managing the sprint and daily standups, mentoring and overseeing junior members, and employee reviews.

*Senior Scientist,* *2011 - 2014*

- Acted as the Principal Investigator leading a team of ten researchers, engineers, and linguists in the IARPA SCIL program designing and developing novel NLP techniques for sociolinguistic analysis of discourse in English, Chinese, and Arabic. 
- Key contributor to numerous government funded projects including the identification and interpretation of metaphor across English, Russian, Farsi, and Spanish.
- Developed methods for the semantic understanding of topics, the induction of conceptual spaces around metaphoric expressions, and the automatic identification of linguistic metaphors.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of research methodologies at numerous IARPA program level meetings, through monthly reports, and presentations at top Natural Language Processing conferences. 
- Researched a method to semi-automatically recognize complex social actions in social media, which was presented to the Office of the Directory of National Intelligence.  

General Electric Global Research, Niskayuna, NY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Computer Scientist,* *2008 - 2011*

- Developed an automated reporting system to analyze user behavior on the NBC web site. Made suggestions adopted by the NBC team based on automated and manual analyses that lead to significant increases in page views, average visit length, and user retention.
- Led the research and development of a social analytics package used to monitor online discussion around NBC television shows and Universal feature movies. The package included software to track mentions, topics, sentiment, and intent to watch. In addition, I developed a method for the automated analysis and ranking of sites in order to determine: 1) which sites would likely partner for a given tv show or movie; and 2) which sites had the best chance to make a video go viral.
- Lead architect and researcher for WISDOM (Web Information Spread Data Operations Module), which became LM (Lockheed Martin) WISDOM. Major areas of research included natural language processing, text mining, information retrieval, blog analysis, social network analysis, web mining, web analytics, and machine learning.
