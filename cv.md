Work Experience
===============================================================================

Oculus360, Addison, TX
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*VP of Technology*, *July, 2014 - Present*

- Oculus360's market intelligence platform is a suite of adaptive, integrated solutions that provide foresight and insights unearthed from contextual consumer behaviour and consumer perceptions. As Senior Data Scientist I lead our efforts in the area of large scale Natural Language Processing and Psycholinguistics to provide insights to our customers. 

Richland College, Dallas, TX
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Adjunct Faculty*, *August, 2013 - Present*

- Taught COSC 1301 Introduction to Computers.

Language Computer Corporation, Richardson, TX
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Senior Scientist,* *March, 2011 - July, 2014*

- Principal Investigator for a team of researchers and engineers for an IARPA project in which we developed novel NLP techniques for sociolinguistic analysis of discourse for multiple languages. Presented the effectiveness of our research at numerous IARPA program level meetings and through monthly reports. In particular, I developed a method to semi-automatically recognize complex social actions in social media which was presented to the Office of the Directory of National Intelligence.  Currently, I have published ten papers around the various methods for inferring social implicatures from online discussion.
- Key contributer to an IARPA project on the identification and interpretation of metaphor across multiple languages. As part of this project I have developed methods for the semantic understanding of topics, the induction of conceptual spaces around metaphoric expressions, and the automatic identification of linguistic metaphors.


General Electric Global Research, Niskayuna, NY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Computer Scientist,* *January, 2008 - March, 2011*

- Developed an automated reporting system to analyze user behavior on the NBC web site. Made suggestions adopted by the NBC team based on automated and manual analyses that lead to significant increases in page views, average visit length, and user retention.
- Lead the research and development of a social analytics package used to monitor online discussion around NBC television shows and Universal feature movies. The package included software to track mentions, topics, sentiment, and intent to watch. In addition, I developed an method for the automated analysis and ranking of sites in order to determine: 1) which sites would likely partner for a given tv show or movie; and 2) which sites had the best chance to make a video go viral.
- Lead architect and researcher for WISDOM (Web Information Spread Data Operations Module), which has become LM WISDOM. Major areas of research included natural language processing, text mining, information retrieval, blog analysis, social network analysis, web mining, web analytics, and machine learning.

AIA International Advanced Information Institute, Tokushima, Japan
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Lead Researcher*, *October, 2006 - October, 2007*

- Lead researcher on a project to build a new type of news system for the Asian region. The designed system is fully self sufficient and includes technology for mining information/knowledge from text to aid in decision making.

The University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Software Engineer,* *August, 2004 - June, 2006*

- Creation of a web based reporting system for the University of Central Florida. The reporting system was designed to report information on research grants.

The University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Research Assistant,* *August, 2003 - June, 2004*

- Investigation of automatic spelling correction techniques for large databases. The project was funded by NASA. The main part of the project was to create a natural language information retrieval system for a set of space shuttle problem reports.
- Was the teaching assitant and substitute lecuturer for the graduate Natural Language Processing class.
